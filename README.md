# How do I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I do this by writing neatly, trying to account for unintended inputs, and creating tests to verify necessary funcitons. This way, I can be confident that my program not only functions properly, but also fails in a controllable way.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Firstly, I would make a bulleted list for all of the functional requirements of the program if I wasn't already given one. Then, I'd go through each requirement and add them one by one, interpretting the requirements as directly as possible.

# How do I approach designing software?

I tend to just open an IDE and start freehanding the program, iterating on my design as I go. Two key points that I try to keep in mind are encapsulation and modularity. Regardless of how my program turns out, I try to design them in a way that they can be easily added to another program.
